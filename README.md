Onkyo eISCP Control, .NET version
---------------------------------

This is a direct port of the PYthon [Python version](https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp),
and you should have a look at the documentation there to get started.

However, note that under "releases" you'll find a compiled binary of the command line tool that
you can use to get started straight away:

    onkyo system-power:on
    
is all you need.
